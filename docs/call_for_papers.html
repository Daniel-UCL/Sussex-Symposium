        <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
        <p>We invite original contributions that develop and assess intelligent tutoring systems, adaptive and multimodal interfaces, and assistive technologies that scaffold attention, curiosity, self-regulation, self-efficacy, and critical reasoning, while supporting collaborative knowledge construction and productive, error-tolerant inquiry. Particular emphasis is placed on technically grounded approaches that integrate system architecture, instructional design, and empirical validation, and that demonstrate measurable gains in learner agency, accessibility, and learning outcomes through robust metrics.</p>
        <p>We particularly encourage contributions that bridge human learning sciences with technical system design in domains such as music instruction, special education for people with sensory disabilities (e.g., sign language and tactile graphics), and inclusive approaches to instructional design. Across contexts, we conceptualize minds as hybrid and distributed across bodies, tools, and social practices; understanding how specific technological architectures shape these processes is key to building equitable, sustainable, and flourishing educational futures.</p>
