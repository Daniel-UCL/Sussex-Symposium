    <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming educational practice and raising both practical and theoretical questions about how learning, cognition, and agency develop in technology-rich environments. This symposium approaches education through an expanded conception of mind, informed by 4E cognition and predictive processing, and conceptualizes classrooms as cognitive niches in which tools, materials, and computational systems function as integral components of the learning process. From this perspective, educational environments do not merely deliver content; they systematically shape and reorganise learners’ cognitive, motivational, metacognitive, and affective dynamics over development.
</p>
    <p>We invite contributions that develop and assess intelligent tutoring systems, adaptive and multimodal interfaces, and assistive technologies that scaffold attention, curiosity, self-regulation, self-efficacy, and critical reasoning, while supporting collaborative knowledge construction and productive, error-tolerant inquiry. Particular emphasis is placed on technically grounded approaches that integrate system architecture, instructional design, and empirical validation, and that demonstrate measurable gains in learner agency, accessibility, and learning outcomes through robust metrics.</p>
    <p>This website provides information about the call for papers, submission process, registration, and organisation.</p>
      <h2>About the Symposium</h2>
