    <h1>Symposium on AI and Cognitive Science in Education</h1>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> 1 July 2026<br>
    <strong>Location:</strong> University of Sussex, Brighton, United Kingdom</p>

    <section>
        <h2>About the Symposium</h2>
        <p>This symposium will form part of the Convention of The Society for the Study of Artificial Intelligence and Simulation of Behaviour (AISB) 2026, which takes place at the University of Sussex in England, UK, on 1-2 July 2026. For details of the convention visit the <a href="https://aisb.org.uk/" target="_new">AISB website</a>.
</p>
        <p>Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming educational practice and raising both practical and theoretical questions about how learning, cognition, and agency develop in technology-rich environments. This symposium approaches education through an expanded conception of mind, informed by 4E cognition and predictive processing, and conceptualizes classrooms as cognitive niches in which tools, materials, and computational systems function as integral components of the learning process. From this perspective, educational environments do not merely deliver content; they systematically shape and reorganise learners’ cognitive, motivational, metacognitive, and affective dynamics over development.</p>
        <p>We invite contributions that develop and assess intelligent tutoring systems, adaptive and multimodal interfaces, and assistive technologies that scaffold attention, curiosity, self-regulation, self-efficacy, and critical reasoning, while supporting collaborative knowledge construction and productive, error-tolerant inquiry. Particular emphasis is placed on technically grounded approaches that integrate system architecture, instructional design, and empirical validation, and that demonstrate measurable gains in learner agency, accessibility, and learning outcomes through robust metrics.</p>
        <p>We particularly encourage contributions that bridge human learning sciences with technical system design in domains such as music instruction, special education (e.g., sign language and tactile graphics technologies), and inclusive approaches to instructional design. Across contexts, we conceptualize minds as hybrid and distributed across bodies, tools, and social practices; understanding how specific technological architectures shape these processes is key to building equitable, sustainable, and flourishing educational futures.</p>
